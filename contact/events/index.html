There were many women like Hannah over time and there are quite a few still with us today. Fancy learning more about Hannah and women like her? Come to the fascinating living history performance at PHM and learn more about Hannah’s life and then join us in a letter writing workshop after the performance. The workshop will be run by Julia Nelson and you will have ample opportunity to learn more about different women in the past and the present if you don’t already know who to write to. The letters will be added to the digital collection at dearfriend.org.uk and some will be displayed during March in the main galleries at PHM. Come and celebrate women in public life with us!</p><p><em>Theatre event is free but booking highly recommended due to limited capacity. <a href="http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/living-history-performance-the-hard-way-up-a-suffragettes-story-tickets-19926787558?aff=ebrowse">Eventbrite booking link</a>, <a href="http://www.phm.org.uk/whatson/living-history-performance-the-hard-way-up-5/">more information on PHM website</a>.</em></p></article><article class="event__container"><h3>“I Think I&#x27;m Gay, Can You Help Me?” Exploring the archives of Friends and Families of Lesbians and Gays.</h3><h4><time>Saturday March 12th 2016, 2:00 pm &ndash; 4:00 pm</time>, Manchester Central Library Archives+</h4><p>At a time of Section 28, the AIDS crisis, and police raids on gay bars, Friends and Families of Lesbians and Gays (FFLAG) supported young and older lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans* (lgbt) people all over the country with letters and information about being l, g, b, or t.
